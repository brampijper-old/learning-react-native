# Combined Repo for tutorials on learning React-Native
This repo consists of projects I made when following the React Native tutorials on Udemy.

#Album Project:
The first project was made to explore the options in react native and covered the re-usable components, props and states.

#Authenticator Project:
During this project I implemented the firebase connecting, so users could log-in with their email and password and update their emailadress accordingly.

#Redux Example:
The third project was being build with the Redux library to get to know Redux more. I learned about reducers, store, actions and the provider tag. 

#Manager:
With this project I will dive deeper into the Redux library. *Currently working on this project
