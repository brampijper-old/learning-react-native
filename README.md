# Combined Repo for tutorials on learning React-Native
This repo consists of project I made when following the React Native tutorials on Udemy.

The first Album project is simply to explore basic options in react native and covered the re-usable components, props and states.

In the authenticator project I implemented the firebase connecting, so users could log-in with their email and password.

The third project was being build with the Redux library and it's a test application to get to know Redux more.

At last the fourth project: "manager" will dive deeper into the Redux library with more reducers and such.
